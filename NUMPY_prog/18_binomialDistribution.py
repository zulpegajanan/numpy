# Binomial Distribution is a Discrete Distribution.
# It describes the outcome of binary scenarios, e.g. toss of a coin, it will either be head or tails.
# It has three parameters:
# n - number of trials.
# p - probability of occurence of each trial (e.g. for toss of a coin 0.5 each).
# size - The shape of the returned array.

# Given 10 trials for coin toss generate 10 data points:
x = random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=10)
